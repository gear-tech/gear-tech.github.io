# Introduction

Here we collect the information helping Rust developers to hack the Gear node, develop Gear smart contracts (a.k.a. programs), etc.

## Crate Docs

The stable crate docs will be posted on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/) after the Gear crates are published. The latest docs are currently at [docs.gear.rs](https://docs.gear.rs/):

* **gear-core**: [https://docs.gear.rs/gear_core](https://docs.gear.rs/gear_core/)

  Gear engine for distributed computing core components.

* **gstd**: [https://docs.gear.rs/gstd](https://docs.gear.rs/gstd/)

  Standard library for Gear smart contracts.
